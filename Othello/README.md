# Othello
## Description
This is a simple implementation of the Othello game. The game is played by two players, one with black pieces and the other with white pieces. The game is played on an 8x8 board. The game starts with 4 pieces in the center of the board, 2 black and 2 white. The players take turns placing their pieces on the board.
### Rules
- A valid move must be made on an empty square on the board.
- The move must outflank at least one of the opponent's discs.
- Outflanking means placing a disc to create a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with another disc of your color, trapping opponent's disc(s) between them.
- The player must place their disc adjacent to an opponent's disc.
- At least one of the opponent's discs must be flipped as a result of the move.
- The player cannot skip over their own color discs to outflank an opponent's disc.
- If a valid move is available, the player must make it and cannot pass their turn.
- All discs outflanked in a single move must be flipped, even if it's disadvantageous to the player.
- Once a disc is placed, it cannot be moved to another square later in the game.
